# Set Up for Using AWS DeepRacer<a name="deepracer-setup"></a>

 Before you can begin using AWS DeepRacer, sign up for the service with an AWS account and create an IAM user\. If you have not already finished these two steps, follow the instructions here\. 

To run AWS DeepRacer securely, you must have appropriate security settings configured in your AWS account\. The AWS DeepRacer console makes it easy to configure these security settings and automatically create the required account resources\. They include VPC to run training jobs and an Amazon S3 bucket to store trained model artifacts\. 

To help you resolve access issues, this section explains the AWS services and policies upon which AWS DeepRacer depends\.
