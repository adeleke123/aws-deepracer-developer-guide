# AWS DeepRacer Virtual Racing Event Types<a name="deepracer-racing-event-types"></a>

Each AWS DeepRacer leaderboard is associated with a racing event that uses a specific track\. An event can be categorized by its sponsor or organizer\. If a racing event is sponsored by AWS, it's referred to as an [AWS DeepRacer League](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/league/) event and is open for any AWS DeepRacer users\. If an event is created by an AWS DeepRacer user, it's known as a community racing event\. 

An AWS DeepRacer racing event can be online or in\-person\. AWS\-sponsored online events are organized in AWS DeepRacer League Virtual Circuit and the in\-person events are in AWS DeepRacer League Summit Circuit\. Community\-based races can also be online or in\-person\.

Although any AWS DeepRacer user can join any open online race in AWS DeepRacer League Virtual Circuit, only invited users can participate in or access a community racing virtual event\. Users are invited when they receive an invitation link sent by the race organizer or forwarded by another race participant\. 

 You can use the AWS DeepRacer console to enter in an AWS DeepRacer Virtual Circuit event or a community\-based online race, submit a trained model for evaluation against specified racing criteria, and get qualified results ranked in the event's leaderboard\. 

If you're an organizer of a community\-based online race, you must create the event and then invite specified users to participate by sending them an invitation link\. If you're an invited participant, you can follow the received invitation link to join the racing event\.

In this chapter, we limit the discussion to virtual leaderboards exclusively\.
