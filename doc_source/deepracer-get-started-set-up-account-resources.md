# Set Up Account Resources for AWS DeepRacer<a name="deepracer-get-started-set-up-account-resources"></a>

To use AWS DeepRacer console and other AWS services, you need an AWS account\. If you don't have an account, visit [aws\.amazon\.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choose **Create an AWS Account**\. For detailed instructions, see [Create and Activate an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)\.

As a best practice, you should also create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user with administrator permissions and use that for all work that does not require root credentials\. Create a password for console access, and access keys to use command line tools\. For instructions, see [Creating Your First IAM Admin User and Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

After you've created your AWS account, sign in to [ the AWS DeepRacer console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/deepracer), with your AWS account or user credentials\. Then, follow the steps below to have the required AWS resources created\. <a name="deepracer-set-up-permissions-and-resources"></a>
