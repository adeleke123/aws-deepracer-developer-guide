# Sign Up Your AWS Account<a name="deepracer-sign-up-aws-account"></a>

To use AWS services, you need an AWS account\. If you don't have one, sign up for one now\. 

The AWS account is free\. You pay only for the AWS services that you use\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Go to [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com](https://portal.aws.amazon.com)\.

1. Choose **Create a Free Account**\.

1. Follow the instructions on the page\.

   Part of the sign\-up process involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN by using the phone keypad\.

 If successful, the sign\-up procedure creates an account with root user credentials, as identified by the email address that you provide\. Although you can use this AWS account root user to sign in to AWS, we recommend that you create an IAM user with administrative privileges to manage your account\. You can also create IAM users with more restricted permissions\. Use these for team members to call AWS services under your account\. The instructions are given in the [next section](deepracer-create-iam-user.md)\.
