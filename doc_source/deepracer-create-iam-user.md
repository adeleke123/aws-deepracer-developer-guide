# Create an IAM User<a name="deepracer-create-iam-user"></a>

 The following procedure walks you through the steps to create an [AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) with administrative privileges\. To sign in to AWS DeepRacer and other services, we recommend that you don't use the root user of your AWS account\. 

**To create an IAM user**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**, then choose **Add user**\.

1. For **Access type**, choose both **Programmatic Access** to call APIs of permitted AWS services and **AWS Management Console Access** to launch the AWS Management Console for permitted services\.

1. For **Console password**, choose **Autogenerated password** or **Custom password**\. If you choose **Custom password**, type a password\.

1. Choose whether to require the user to reset the password at the next sign\-in, then choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. For **Set permissions for *<user name>***, choose **Attach existing policies directly**, **AdministrativeAccess**, and **Next: Review**\.

1. Review the settings\. To return to the previous page to make changes, choose **Previous**\. To create the user, choose **Create user**\.

 For a non\-administrative user to use AWS DeepRacer, follow the same steps to create an IAM user, but attach appropriate non\-administrative access IAM roles and policies\. If the role is not already created, the AWS DeepRacer service creates an appropriate IAM role with required policies upon request\. You don't have to manually specify the access permission for AWS DeepRacer\. For instructions to create the required roles and policies, see [Required IAM Roles for AWS DeepRacer to Call Dependent AWS Services](deepracer-understand-required-permissions-and-iam-roles.md)\. 

 Now that you have an AWS account and IAM user, you're ready to explore AWS DeepRacer\. Learn reinforcement learning and explore its application to autonomous racing\.
